Installation
============
### Download
To download this hud, click the "Download ZIP" button to the right.

### Installing
After extracting the hud, navigate to: /Steam/steamapps/common/team fortress 2/tf/custom and move "budhud" into your custom folder.

Your directory should then look like this: /Steam/steamapps/common/team fortress 2/tf/custom/budhud and contain "_misc files", "materials", "resource", and "scripts"

Custom Crosshairs
=================
To access the custom crosshairs, navigate to \budhud\scripts\hudlayout.res. I've included whayay's, fog's, Garm3n's & konr's crosshairs. If I'm missing crosshairs or you find any bugs with them, let me know.
