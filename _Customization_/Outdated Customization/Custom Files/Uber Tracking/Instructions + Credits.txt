Notes: 
- Using any voicemenu will restart the counter
- Respawning will cause the counter to stop
	* There are no known work arounds for either of these
- Only shows on medic, with your medigun out

1. Move hudmediccharge.res to \custom\budhud\resource\ui.

2. Set up this script in your autoexec or medic config that will be used to start the tracker:
alias 	+uber_counter 	"voice_menu_1"
alias 	-uber_counter 	"voice_menu_1"
bind 	KEY 			+uber_counter
