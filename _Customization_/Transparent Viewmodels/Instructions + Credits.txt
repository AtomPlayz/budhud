NOTE: Does NOT work with dx8 users, only dx9.

1. Go into "Files" and then your appropriate OS. Move "REFRACTnormal_transparent.vmt" and "REFRACTnormal_transparent.vtf" into custom\budhud\materials\vgui\replay\thumbnails.

2. Navigate to \custom\budhud\scripts\hudlayout.res and set "visible" and "enable" to 1 under the TransparentViewmodelMask section of code.

3. If you experience issues with it not working, set these commands in your graphics config or autoexec:
mat_motion_blur_enabled 1 		// the only sure-fire way to keep refract masking on
mat_motion_blur_strength 0 		// effectively disables motion blur, personal choice + motion blur gets masked and looks bad with refract masking
mat_disable_bloom 1 			// disables bloom so refract masking doesn't create a dark rectangle over light materials

Some people have luck with this working without these commands being entered, though, so I would try it without them added first.
