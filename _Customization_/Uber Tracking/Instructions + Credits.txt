Notes: 
- Using any voicemenu will restart the counter
- Respawning will cause the counter to stop
	* There are no known work arounds for either of these

1. Navigate to ..\budhud\scripts\bh_hudanimations\bh_ubertracking.res and remove the comment (//) on line 9

2. Set up this script in your autoexec. This will be used to start the tracker:
alias 	+uber_counter 	"voice_menu_1"
alias 	-uber_counter 	"voice_menu_1"
bind 	KEY 			+uber_counter 

Alternatively, you can simply open and close the voice menu in-game to start the tracker.
