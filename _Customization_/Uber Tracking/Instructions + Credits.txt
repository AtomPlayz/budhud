Notes: 
- Using any voicemenu will restart the counter
- Respawning will cause the counter to stop
	* There are no known work arounds for either of these
- Will be shown on any class when enabled

1. In ..\budhud\scripts\hudanimations_manifest.txt, uncomment line 9 (remove the two //)

2. Set up this script in your autoexec or medic config that will be used to start the tracker:
alias 	+uber_counter 	"voice_menu_1"
alias 	-uber_counter 	"voice_menu_1"
bind 	KEY 			+uber_counter
